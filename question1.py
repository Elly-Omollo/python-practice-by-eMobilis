# Variable assignment and Arithmetic operator
# 
#  Write a program that assigns two numbers to variables a and b. Perform the following
# operations and print the results:
# ● Addition
# ● Subtraction
# ● Multiplication
# ● Division


# variable assignment
a=80
b=20

print("\t Numbers for operations are: \n  \t", a , "and", b)
print("\n")
# adding the numbers 
c = a+b
print("\t Addition Ans = ",c)

# Substraaction
s = a-b
print("\t Substraction Ans = ", s)


# Multiplication
m = a*b
print("\t Multiplication  Ans = ", m)

# Division
d = a/b
print("\t Division Ans = ", d)
print("\n")
